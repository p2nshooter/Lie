          "The expansion from three products to ten did not follow any change in the evidence. It followed the structure of the industry, in which growth requires either more customers or more products per customer, and the second is considerably easier to achieve.",
          "Each additional category was introduced with a plausible-sounding function: something to prepare the skin, something to seal, something targeted at a specific concern. None of these is fraudulent, and very few of them have evidence that they add anything on top of a cleanser, a moisturiser and sunscreen.",
          "This is worth understanding because it reframes the question. The default assumption when reading about skincare is that a longer routine is more thorough and therefore better. The more accurate assumption is that a longer routine is more profitable, and that any individual step needs to justify itself on evidence rather than on the general principle that more care is better.",

        h: "How more products make skin worse",
        p: [
          "The mechanism by which additional products cause problems is not mysterious. Every product applied is an additional set of ingredients contacting the skin, and each carries some probability of irritation or allergic sensitisation. Applying twelve products multiplies that exposure.",
          "The more common problem is a damaged skin barrier, which is what results from over-cleansing, over-exfoliating, or layering multiple active ingredients. The presentation is characteristic: skin that feels tight, stings when products are applied, looks red or flushed, and is simultaneously oily and flaky. People experiencing this frequently respond by adding more products, which is precisely the wrong direction.",
          "The other cost is diagnostic. With twelve products in a routine, identifying the one causing a reaction requires removing everything and reintroducing one at a time over several weeks. With three, the culprit is usually obvious within days.",

        h: "Cleansing, and how much is enough",
        p: [
          "The purpose of cleansing is to remove sunscreen, makeup, excess oil and environmental deposits. It is not to make skin feel squeaky, which is a sign that the cleanser has stripped more than it needed to and disrupted the barrier in the process.",
          "For most people, once daily in the evening is sufficient, with a rinse of water in the morning. Skin does not accumulate much overnight beyond its own sebum, and a second full cleanse adds irritation without adding benefit. Anyone who works in a dusty environment or exercises heavily has a reasonable case for a second wash.",
          "The choice of cleanser matters less than the frequency, provided it is gentle and non-foaming or mildly foaming. Water temperature is worth mentioning: hot water increases the removal of skin lipids and contributes to the tight, stripped sensation that people then try to correct with more product.",

          "A great deal of writing is devoted to the correct sequence of application, and the underlying principle is simple: thinner formulations before thicker ones, so that a heavy occlusive does not prevent a lighter product from reaching the skin.",
          "Beyond that, the precision claimed is not supported. The idea that products must be applied in a specific order to a specific timing, or that waiting a set number of minutes between them is essential, is largely marketing. Skin is not that sensitive to sequence.",
          "The two genuine considerations are that sunscreen goes on last in the morning, after anything else has absorbed, and that products with very different pH requirements are better separated in time — one in the morning and one in the evening — rather than layered. Neither requires a chart.",

        p: [
          "The single most useful discipline in skincare is to introduce one product at a time and wait before adding another. Four to six weeks is a reasonable interval, because that is roughly how long visible change takes for most active ingredients and how long a delayed irritation reaction may take to appear.",
          "Introducing three products simultaneously and observing an improvement tells you nothing about which one produced it. Observing a reaction tells you nothing about which one caused it. Both outcomes leave you with less information than you started with, despite having spent more money.",
          "Patch testing is worth doing for anything containing a new active ingredient: apply a small amount to a discreet area for several days before using it on the face. This does not eliminate the possibility of a reaction and it catches a meaningful proportion of them before they affect a visible area.",

        h: "What deserves a fourth step",
        p: [
          "The minimal routine handles the fundamentals, and there are circumstances where a fourth product is justified. The clearest is a specific, identified concern with an ingredient that has evidence behind it: a retinoid for photoageing or acne, a benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid preparation for acne, azelaic acid for redness or pigmentation.",
          "The criterion is that there is a specific problem and a specific ingredient with reasonable evidence for it, rather than a general desire to do more. Products marketed for vague objectives — brightening, refining, restoring — usually lack a defined mechanism and are the ones most likely to add cost without adding effect.",
          "Where a genuine concern exists and over-the-counter options have not helped after a fair trial of several months, that is the point at which a dermatologist becomes worth the cost. Prescription options are considerably stronger than anything on a shelf, and persistent problems frequently resolve quickly once the right treatment is identified.",

        h: "Consistency beats optimisation",
        p: [
          "The gap between a good routine and an optimal one is small. The gap between a routine that is followed and one that is not is enormous, and it is where nearly all of the actual difference in outcomes lives.",
          "This has a design implication. A three-step routine performed every day for five years produces better results than a nine-step routine performed enthusiastically for two months and then abandoned, and the second pattern is considerably more common. Complexity is the main predictor of abandonment.",
          "So the case for the minimal version is not that elaborate routines cannot work. It is that most of the benefit comes from a small number of steps, that the remainder adds cost and irritation risk, and that simplicity is what makes daily use survive a busy month. None of this is medical advice, and anyone with a persistent or worsening skin condition should see a clinician rather than adjust products indefinitely.",

          "The claim that sunscreen is the best-supported anti-ageing step rests on a specific body of research rather than on general reasoning. A randomised controlled trial conducted in Australia over several years found measurably less skin ageing in participants using daily sunscreen compared with those using it discretionarily.",
          "That study design is unusual in cosmetic science, where most claims rest on short-term measurements or manufacturer testing. A randomised trial running for years, with objective assessment, is a considerably stronger form of evidence than anything supporting most serums.",
          "There is a separate and larger body of evidence on skin cancer prevention, which is the more important outcome. Regular sunscreen use has been associated with reduced incidence of melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma in trial and observational data. The cosmetic benefit is real and secondary.",

        p: [
          "The SPF number describes protection against UVB radiation, which causes burning. It is not a linear scale and it is not a duration: SPF 30 filters roughly ninety-seven percent of UVB and SPF 50 roughly ninety-eight, which is a smaller difference than the numbers suggest.",
          "UVA radiation penetrates more deeply, contributes substantially to photoageing, and is not described by the SPF figure at all. Different regions label UVA protection differently — a circled UVA mark, a star rating, or the PA notation — and checking for one of these matters as much as the SPF number.",
          "The practical consequence is that a broad-spectrum product at SPF 30 or above, used properly, is more useful than a higher SPF without UVA protection. The higher numbers are worth having and the difference between them is smaller than the difference between applying enough and applying too little.",

      },
      {
        h: "The application quantity problem",
        p: [
          "The single largest gap between laboratory performance and real-world protection is quantity. Products are tested at an application density that most people do not come close to matching, and studies of actual use consistently find people applying between a quarter and half of the tested amount.",
          "Because the relationship between quantity and protection is not linear, applying half the tested amount does not give half the SPF; it gives substantially less than half. A high-SPF product applied thinly can deliver less real protection than a moderate one applied properly.",
          "The commonly cited guides — around a teaspoon for the face and neck, or the two-finger-length measure — are approximations of the tested density. They look like more product than seems necessary, which is precisely the point: the amount that feels right is reliably too little.",

        h: "Mineral and chemical filters",
        p: [
          "Sunscreens work through filters that either absorb ultraviolet radiation and dissipate it as heat, or reflect and scatter it. The first group is commonly called chemical or organic; the second, based on zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, is called mineral or physical. The distinction is less clean than the labels suggest, since mineral filters also absorb a substantial proportion.",
          "Neither category is inherently superior. Mineral filters are less likely to cause stinging or irritation, which makes them a reasonable default for sensitive skin, and they historically left a visible white cast, which newer formulations have reduced but not eliminated on deeper skin tones.",
          "Modern chemical filters are typically more cosmetically elegant and achieve broad-spectrum coverage more easily. Filter availability varies substantially between regulatory regions, which is why products sold in different countries can perform quite differently despite similar labelling. The best sunscreen is the one you will apply every day in adequate quantity, which is a preference question rather than a chemistry one.",

        h: "Reapplication in ordinary life",
        p: [
          "The standard advice to reapply every two hours is derived from conditions involving sun exposure, swimming, sweating and towelling, and it is entirely appropriate for those. Applying it unmodified to someone who works indoors produces advice that is ignored because it is impractical.",
          "The considerations that actually determine reapplication are physical removal and time outdoors. Someone commuting, sitting indoors all day and commuting home has had limited exposure and limited removal. Someone spending a lunch hour outside, or working near a window, has more.",
          "A workable approach for indoor workers is a morning application in adequate quantity and one reapplication before any substantial afternoon outdoor period. For anyone outdoors for extended stretches, the two-hour guidance applies as stated. Powder and stick formats exist specifically to make midday reapplication over makeup practical, and while they are harder to apply at the tested density, some reapplication is better than none.",

        h: "The myths that keep people unprotected",
        p: [
          "Several persistent beliefs reduce use, and each is worth addressing directly. That sunscreen is unnecessary on cloudy days is false: a substantial proportion of UV penetrates cloud cover, and UVA in particular passes through window glass, which is why one-sided facial photoageing is documented in drivers.",
          "That darker skin does not require it is a partial truth misapplied. Higher melanin does provide meaningful natural protection and does not eliminate photoageing, hyperpigmentation or skin cancer risk. Skin cancers in people with deeper skin tones are diagnosed later and have worse outcomes, which makes protection more rather than less relevant.",
          "That sunscreen prevents adequate vitamin D is not supported by the trial evidence, which has generally found that realistic sunscreen use does not produce deficiency. Anyone concerned about vitamin D status has a considerably safer route available through diet or supplementation, and should discuss it with a clinician rather than reduce sun protection to address it.",

        h: "Making daily use actually happen",
        p: [
          "Everything above is irrelevant if the product sits unused, and the reasons people stop are consistent and addressable. The most common is texture: a product that feels greasy, leaves a cast, stings the eyes or interferes with makeup will be abandoned regardless of how well it performs.",
          "This makes the search for a formulation you genuinely like a worthwhile investment rather than vanity. The range of textures available now is wide, and trying several small sizes to find one that is pleasant is a better use of money than buying a highly rated product that you will not apply.",
          "The second measure is placement. Keeping the product where the routine already happens — beside the toothbrush, in a bag, at a desk — removes the friction that causes it to be skipped on rushed mornings. As with everything on this site, this is educational rather than medical advice, and anyone with a history of skin cancer or a specific condition should follow the guidance of their own clinician.",

        h: "The protection that is not a product",
        p: [
          "Sunscreen is one component of sun protection and it is frequently treated as the whole of it, which leads people to rely on a product where physical measures would work better. Shade, timing and clothing all outperform sunscreen on the metric that matters, which is how much radiation reaches the skin.",
          "Ultraviolet intensity varies enormously through the day, peaking in the middle hours, which means shifting an outdoor activity by two hours can reduce exposure more than any product. A wide-brimmed hat protects the face, ears and neck continuously without needing reapplication. Tightly woven clothing, and garments rated for ultraviolet protection, do the same for the body.",
          "The practical framing is that sunscreen covers what the other measures cannot: the face, the hands, and anything exposed during ordinary daily movement. It works best as the last layer of a strategy rather than as the entirety of one, and this is particularly relevant for extended outdoor activity where reapplication is unreliable.",

          "Sunscreen filters degrade over time and formulations are tested to remain effective until a stated date. A product several years past that date, or one that has separated, changed colour or developed an unusual smell, should be replaced rather than trusted.",
          "Storage matters more than for most cosmetics. Heat accelerates degradation, which means a bottle left in a car through a summer is a poor bet regardless of its printed date. The same applies to leaving it in direct sun at a beach, which is where it is most likely to happen and most consequential.",
          "There is a useful implication in the other direction. Anyone applying the recommended quantity daily will get through a standard bottle in a matter of weeks, not years, which means expiry rarely becomes an issue for people using it properly. A bottle that has lasted two years is itself evidence that too little is being applied.",

          "The three steps do not all belong at the same time of day, and separating them correctly removes most of the remaining complexity. Sunscreen is a morning product with no purpose in the evening. Cleansing is primarily an evening task, since the point is removing what accumulated during the day.",
          "That produces a simple structure: in the morning, rinse or gently cleanse, moisturise if the skin needs it, apply sunscreen. In the evening, cleanse properly, apply any treatment product, and moisturise. Two short sequences rather than one long one.",
          "Anything active generally belongs in the evening, both because several ingredients degrade in sunlight and because it avoids layering under sunscreen. This is also the practical reason the evening routine is where a fourth step usually goes, while the morning stays minimal.",

        p: [
          "Since over-treating is the main risk of an elaborate routine, it is worth knowing the presentation. A compromised skin barrier typically causes tightness, stinging on application of products previously tolerated, visible redness, rough or flaky patches, and increased sensitivity to temperature and wind.",
          "The correction is subtraction rather than addition. Stop all active ingredients and exfoliants. Reduce to a gentle cleanser once daily and a bland moisturiser, ideally one containing ceramides or similar barrier lipids, applied as often as the skin wants it. Continue sunscreen, since damaged skin is more vulnerable rather than less.",
          "Most cases improve substantially within two to four weeks on this regimen. Actives can then be reintroduced one at a time, at lower frequency than before, with the frequency raised only if the skin tolerates it. Anything that does not improve on a simplified routine within a month warrants a clinical opinion rather than further experimentation.",
